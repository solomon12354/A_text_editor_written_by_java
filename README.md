# A_text_editor_written_by_java
When I was a student, our Object-Oriented programming professor asked us that we had to do a text editor by Programming Java.
So I did it.
	
	After doing this homework, I learned how to make a GUI for the java application. Our program no longer only has a command line, we can set a GUI to make our program more user friendly.
	At first, I didn’t know how to save the file, so I used “Open file” to save the file. This solution looked good, but that was not a good way to save the file. Because of this, I searched the Internet for the function of saving the file. I found a lot of websites tell us how to save. Finally, I succeed.
	When I was doing the homework, I thought a lot, such as creating a new file, saving as a new file, and possible undesirable situations when creating a new file, so I not only used function, but also used some if else expression.
	I got a lot of self-confidence of programming Java, I hope I can use my Java skill  to make a video game.
